This repository demonstrates a common COBOL error: numeric overflow. The `bug.cob` file shows code that can cause an overflow error if input values are too large or operations result in out-of-range values.  The `bugSolution.cob` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling, demonstrating best practices for avoiding this type of error.  The solution focuses on data validation and input checks to prevent the overflow before it happens.
